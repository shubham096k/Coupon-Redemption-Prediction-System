# Coupon-Redemption-Prediction-System

Developed a coupon redemption prediction model using LightGBM with class-weight adjustments, achieving 95% test accuracy and 0.989 ROC-AUC, significantly improving targeting efficiency in marketing campaigns.

Engineered and preprocessed data from 6 heterogeneous sources (customer demographics, transactions, campaign, coupon mappings, etc.), handling severe class imbalance (<1% positive samples) through weighted modeling and threshold optimization.

Optimized model performance via RandomizedSearchCV and threshold tuning, striking a balance between precision and recall to minimize false positives, thereby enhancing the ROI of targeted promotional offers.
